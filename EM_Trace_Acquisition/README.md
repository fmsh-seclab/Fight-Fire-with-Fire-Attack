## EM Signal Acquisition
To identify the optimal location for EM signal capture, multiple positions on the TOE were tested using probes of various shapes. The `Langer EMV RF-R 3-2` probe positioned at the location indicated in Figure 4 captured distinctive signals. These signals were closely correlated with the TOE's signature verification and firmware decryption operations.
